# Intro

What is the blockchain? 
What are NFTs? https://ethereum.org/en/nft
What is R?

Letâ€™s first introduce ourselves: we are data scientists in the pharma industry, passionate by the blockchain and we love art. We thus decided to put these ingredients together to write this article.
You probably know a few basics about the blockchain and how it works. But how to extract data from the blockchain?

There are several market places where to buy NFTs. We will focus here on OpenSea, probably the largest NFT trading places one at the moment.  
Fortunately for us, there are API which facilitates our work.



```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
```

# OpenSea



```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
